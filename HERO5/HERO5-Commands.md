#### Pairing:

GoPro HERO5 cameras (Black version under 2.60 firmware at least) have to receive two "GET" requests in order to accept a
new device (for the first time ?).

Once connected to the WiFi of the GoPro you have to call those two URL :
https://10.5.5.9/bacpac/cv
https://10.5.5.9/gp/gpControl/command/wireless/pair/complete?success=1&deviceName=FIXME_DEVICE_NAME

##### Example (from Windows 10 simulating GoPro App)

GET /bacpac/cv HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.5.5.9
Connection: Keep-Alive

Response :
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Allow: GET 
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Cache-Control: no-cache
Cache-Control: no-store
Connection: Keep-Alive
Server: GoPro Web Server v1.1
Content-Type: application/octet-stream
Content-Length: 29

Host: 10.5.5.9

#### Connecting to a WiFi network:

* Scan for available networks: http://10.5.5.9/gp/gpControl/command/wireless/ssid/scan?p=1
* Return JSON of available networks: http://10.5.5.9/gp/gpControl/command/wireless/ssid/list

the JSON structure is:

```
{
  "scan_id": 1,
  "total": 5,
  "index": 0,
  "index_count": 5,
  "ssid_array": [
    {
      "ssid": "MyHomeNetwork",
      "auth_type": 1,
      "bars": 0
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

* Save the network: http://10.5.5.9/gp/gpControl/command/wireless/ssid/save?ssid=WIFI_SSID&auth_type=AUTH_TYPE&pw=SSID_PASSWORD
	* WIFI_SSID = ssid
	* AUTH_TYPE = auth_type from the /list JSON, an integer (1 in the example)
	* SSID_PASSWORD = SSID password
* Connect to network: http://10.5.5.9/gp/gpControl/command/wireless/ssid/select?ssid=WIFI_SSID&auth_type=AUTH_TYPE&pw=SSID_PASSWORD
